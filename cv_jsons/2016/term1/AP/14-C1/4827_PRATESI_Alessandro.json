Before moving to the United States, I worked for several years with temporary contracts at the Department of Sociology (University of Florence). Shortly after my graduation in February 1993, I started working as a researcher at the Department of Sociology of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (University of Florence). During that period, I further developed my knowledge of and expertise in qualitative research methods (in-depth interviews, ethnographic work, focus group, visual sociology, etc.) as well as my skills in coaching other junior researchers and supervising their work. At the Department of Sociology I also taught a range of classes and seminars on several topic areas: Sociology of Family; Sociology of Deviance; Sociology of Health and Illness.",

My research interests include the Sociology of Emotions; Relationships, Intimacies and Families; Care and the Ethics of care; Cultural Citizenship and Social Change; Innovative Qualitative Methods. I am currently working on a ESRC project on the EU refugee crisis. The project aims to overcome conventional approaches to migration, citizenship and social inclusion merely based on economic, political, static and normative interpretations of the reality. The project's general goal is providing a critical understanding of major social and cultural changes involving people\u2019s experiences and ideas of migration, citizenship and care and identifying the conditions under which such changes become a resource and can be seen as such. I then work on a book publication which is aimed to: 1) rethinking Care through more inclusive approaches and getting closer to its complex nature and less visible implications; and 2) shedding light on the emotion-based, interactional and anti-assimilationist model of social inclusion represented by same-sex parents (Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming: 2017).",
